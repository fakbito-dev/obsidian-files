## Goals

- [ ] learn basic algorithm
- [ ] finally make some leetcode
- [ ] read 50 page of the book im reading

## Tasks

- [ ] study at least 4 hour per day in side projects
- [ ] do exercise the whole week
- [ ] Learn:
  - [ ] quick Sort
  - [ ] heap Sort
  - [ ] Merge Sort
  - [ ] Binary Search
  - [ ] Linear Search
- [x] take at least 30 minutes or 1 hour to read

## Reflection

- [ ] Initial Survey & High-Level Understanding (10-20% of time):
  - Read broadly: Get a general sense of what the data structure or algorithm is.
  - Understand the "Why": Focus on why it exists and what problems it's designed to solve.
  - Look at Simple Examples: Mentally trace one or two tiny examples
  - to start building an intuition.

- [ ] Detailed Exploration & Pseudo-code/Logic (30-40% of time):

- Dive deeper into specifics: Read about its step-by-step operations and common implementations.
- Write pseudo-code or outline steps: Describe the logic in plain language before writing
- actual code. This helps you clarify the sequence of operations without syntax distractions.
- Trace with pen and paper: Take a slightly larger example and manually step through the
  algorithm. Write down the state of your data at each step. This is a powerful technique
  for catching logical errors early.

- [ ] Implementation (30-40% of time):
  - Translate your logic into code: Use your pseudo-code as a guide.
  - Test incrementally: Test small parts as you go, or use console.log
  - statements to monitor variable states.
  - Keep documentation handy: Refer back to the
    problem statement or algorithm steps if you get stuck.

- [ ] Review & Refine (5-10% of time):
  - Compare (if needed): If you're truly stuck, look at a well-explained solution.
  - Understand the differences: Don't just copy; analyze why
  - their solution is structured differently or more effective.
  - Refactor: Once your code works, consider ways to make it cleaner,
    more readable, or more efficient.
