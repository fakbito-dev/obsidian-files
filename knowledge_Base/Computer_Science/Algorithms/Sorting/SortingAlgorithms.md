## Core Concept

> _Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison
> operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in
> the respective data structure. For example, the numerical order is a commonly used sequence but
> a lexicographical order is also a commonly used sequence type. There are several types of sorting
> algorithms: quick sort, bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, selection sort, heap sort,
> radix sort, bucket sort among others. Each has its own properties and are suited to specific
> types of tasks and data._
