### 1. Try to write the important subjects from the memory not reread

Focus in yourself instead of read notes or reread
articles for make strongest your brain

## 2. Spread the knowledge

Try to Distribute the sessions of learning.
Not trying to learn all in large sessions

## 3. mixed to domain

Try to mix problems together in order to force you to use the things you learn

## 4. be one with the hard tasks

you need to struggle in order to get better in the field you want to develop,
is the learning is easy that means you are in auto pilot and that's not good

## 5. Teach it (Explain with simple words Macro -> micro)

try to explain the things you are learning in simple word,
that a children can understand if you cant do that means
you don't know the subject good enough

Use elaboration: try to explain with you simple words a subject

## 6. Use all you sense to learn

Some People say they learn more with only vision or reading but that's not true,
you can learn a lot when you get align with the theme you are learning,
for example,
a programmer need to see and read files in order to get better in the field,
if he just watch videos and never code or only read and never code
he will never learn how to program anything.

## 7. the illusion of know

know something is not understand a little, is memorize everything,
when you use notes (like this) or read and highlight things your brain have
the perception of knowing but then when you are in a test or on your work and
you don't remember nothing is when you realize that things don't work.
that's the mean of the illusion of know. only have notes doesn't mean your
brain is gonna remembered. the brain remember the thing he use it.
you need to practice things in order to remember not only taking notes.
when the study feels easy try to describe
the subject with only memory and you will see if you really understand or not.
when you get stuck is a good thing because your brain need to work harder
in order to remember things and you can determinate your weakness

## 8. Your brain is like a muscle, he grows

there are two mindset

- the growth mind
- the stuck mind
  Learning is and skill that you can develop,
  is not something what you born with.
  a grow mind feel struggle and hard work like and opportunity to growth
  instead of the stuck mind that thinks he's not good enough and give up,
  when thing get hard remember `MY BRAIN IS GROWING WITH THIS TASK` you need
  to look back and see how better are you today than the past.

## 9. Mistake in purpose

Try to do Mistake is good for your brain because when you fail in something
you brain create a hook that can be useful when you try to remember the
correct answer of things is like get lost in a town, when you find your path
you never forget it, wherever you try to learn something stop for a moment
and try to think, "how much i know about this",
"can i predict how this things work?" try to explain it, if you are wrong,
well that's good because
you are gonna learn better.

## 10. try to learn the idea, not just only remember things

you can now the structured or how to use a phone,
but you cant make one because you don't understand how is make this is the
difference between know how things work and just memorize things.

## 11. Learning that last is build, not born

Learn is a skill not a privilege, in order to get good at learning you need to
use method efficiently and intelligent,
is not working hard is working with intelligent,
the people who learn more is the people who develop good habits like
questioning using learn spacing and mixes being discipline and constant.

## 12. forget the motivation, use the system

the feelings like motivation and willpower,
can be low or high depending the day,
but the system are constant you need to use it in order to have
better performance in your learning path, thing like studying
the same hour every day,
having hour of checking wondering and using the tools we
learn writing this article.

## 13. Use time to reflect

when you finish a session or a work day, take some time to reflect
in what you can do better or how thing get like that,
that make you learn for your behavior and get better for the next thing
or session you are working it learn for your mistakes or improve your methods
and things DON'T GET STUCK IN LIFE.

## 14. take it easy

learning is a marathon not a race, take long time to learn things don't try to
rush it take your time,
getting fast don't set you in a good spot enjoy the learning is not bad for you,
is a life style don't force yourself to much because
not working 12 hour a day can become you a good engineer faster or slower, is
good in life make a step back and think.
when you get reflect you can go forward with a fresh mind,
keep it up the good work.

## 15. don't have fear for failure

in life your gonna get punch, your gonna fall so much times,
but you need to get back every time. the loser, the low elos, the average man,
get comfort and don't take risk in life and they live his life miserable
just dreaming about being someone, Mauricio this is for you,
you are better than that don't lose the faith, work hard, work smart,
don't hesitate, don't give up, you can do it, i believe in you,make yourself
and you important person proud. don't live in repentance. i'll be with you
in every step, stay hard. Thu 15 May 20:37 05/15/2025.
