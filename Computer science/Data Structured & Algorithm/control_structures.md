are the way how a program or system structure the flow of the programs and there are three types

- Sequence logic, or sequential flow
- Selection logic, or conditional flow
- iteration logic, or repetitive flow

## Sequence Logic

follow the flow of the instructions in the way that are given, you need to add new instructions in order to change the sequence

# Selection Logic

When a code is true execute a block of code, is doesn't jump over or execute another code instead.

# Iteration Control

Allows block of code execute be repeated multiple times Like `For`, `While` and `Do while` loops, this loops are important shaping in the program logic.
