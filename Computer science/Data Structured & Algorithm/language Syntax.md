Syntax refers to the rules that define the structure of a language. Syntax in computer programming means the rules that control the structure of the symbols, punctuation, and words of a programming language.

Without syntax, the meaning or semantics of a language is nearly impossible to understand.

If the syntax of a language is not followed, the code will not be understood by a compiler or interpreter.

**Compilers:** convert programming languages like  Java or C++ into binary code that computers can understand.  If the syntax is incorrect, the code will not compile.

**Interpreters:** execute programming languages such as JavaScript or Python at runtime. The incorrect syntax will cause the code to fail.

That’s why it is crucial that a programmer pays close attention to a language’s syntax. No programmer likes to get a syntax error.

## What Is Basic Syntax

Basic syntax represents the fundamental rules of a programming language. Without these rules, it is impossible to write functioning code.

Every language has its own set of rules that make up its basic syntax. Naming conventions are a primary component of basic syntax conventions and vary by language.

- **Case Sensitive**. Java, C++, and Python are examples of languages that are case-sensitive. Identifiers such as ***world*** and ***World*** have different meanings in these languages. Languages such as Basic and SQL are insensitive, meaning world and World have the same meaning.
- **Class Names.** Java requires the first letter of each word in class names be upper case. For example, ***class* *FirstJavaClass.*** Languages such as C or C++ use an underscore to separate words.  In C, the class name would be first_java_class.
- **Program Filenames.** The name of a Java program file must match the class name with the extension ‘_.java” added to the name. For example, ***FirstJavaClass.java*** would be the name of the program file for the class *FirstJavaClass*. C and C++ files require a “_.c” or “\*.cpp” extension but have no other stipulations.

Different languages may have rules for adding comments, using white space, or declaring variables.

Object-oriented languages such as Java and C use methods that have different syntax requirements.

The first step in learning any programming language is to understand the basics such as phrase structure, proper syntax and correctly structured code.
